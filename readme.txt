Add Galleria photo galleries to your site.

== Description ==

Galleria in WordPress allows you to easily add photo galleries to your site via the backend. 

This initial version is not bare bones, but most of the customizable functionality of Galleria is not there. Let me know what you want from the plugin and I'll update it!

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

e.g.

1. Upload the `galleria-in-wordpress` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Use the shortcode tag [galleria name="gallery-name" width="css-custom-width-value" height="css-custom-height-value"] anywhere in a post or page

== Screenshots ==

1. A custom post type will pop up in the admin menu called "Galleries". Create your galleries here
2. When editing a gallery, give it a unique name to be used in the shortcode, and add your photos here
3. After clicking "Add images to Gallery," the standard WordPress image chooser pops up. After uploading an image, an "Add to Gallery" link will show up in the bottom of the box. Click it to add the image to Gallery. Keep in mind the values for "Title" and "Caption" are what is used by Galleria for the info tags.
4. You can also add images to the Gallery via the "Media Library" tab in the image chooser. An "Add to Gallery" link is added next to every image. Click it and the image will be added to the gallery.
5. Use the shortcode [galleria] to add a gallery to a post or page. width and height can be set to any CSS value (100%, 40em, etc.)
6. Voila! Your gallery is inserted into the page dynamically.
